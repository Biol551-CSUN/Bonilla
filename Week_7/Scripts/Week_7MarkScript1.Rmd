When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
## Libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)

```

## Data Set


```{r}
# Read in data on population in California by county
popdata<-read_csv(here("Week_7","data","CApopdata.csv"))

#read in data on number of seastars at different field sites
stars<-read_csv(here("Week_7","data","stars.csv"))

head(states)
```


## Mapping
```{r}
# can be world, country, state, county level
world<-map_data("world") 

CA_data<-states%<%
  filter(region == "california")
```
## Plotting 
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_polygon(data = world, 
               aes(x = long, 
                   y = lat, 
                   group = group,
                   fill = region),
               color = "black")+
  theme_minimal()+
  guides(fill = FALSE)+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill "lightblue"))+
  coord_map(projection = "mercator",
            xlim = c(-180,180))

ggplot()+
  geom_polygon(data = CA_data,
               aes(long,
                   y = lat,
                   group = group))
```
